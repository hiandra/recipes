Ingredients:
-2 eggs 
-2 tablespoons whole milk 
-2 tablespoons clarified butter (or whole butter) 
-Salt and ground white pepper (to taste) 
-Filling of your choice (options are below) 

Directions:
  1. Crack the eggs into a glass mixing bowl and beat them until they turn a pale yellow color.
  2. Heat a heavy-bottomed nonstick saut√© pan over medium-low heat. Add the butter and let it melt.
  3. Add the milk to the eggs and season to taste with salt and white pepper. Then, grab your whisk and whisk like crazy. You're going to want to work up a sweat here. If you're not up for that, you can use an electric beater or stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Whatever device you use, you're trying to beat as much air as possible into the eggs.
